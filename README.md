# Keyframe Linker - Blender Addon

Links keyframe timestamps in Blender and copies stuff from the current linked keyframe to all the others on save. It's janky and I don't even remember how exactly it works. 

Commands:
- Link Frames
- Flip Linked Frames

Please do let me know if you make a better version of this.
